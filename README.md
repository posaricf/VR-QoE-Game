# VR-QoE-Game

A VR game in which the player learns about creating quality of experience questionnaires. The player creates short questionnaires based on the goal of the room in which they are located. 

The game is to be used in education as a creative way of learning about quality of experience, focused on subjective methods of questioning. It aims to teach the player to identify the goals of QoE testing while interactively creating basic questionnaires. Starting with the school year 2023/24, it's to be used as an additional learning material in a new school program.

Player's first and last location is a classroom. There they get to learn how to conduct a QoE testing, game rules and controls and to set a few settings. After the game, when they are returned to the classroom, the player will need to solve a quiz as a way of recapitulation of acquired knowledge. On the panel where the menu was at the beginning, there is a quiz with questions related to the game. If the player chooses the correct answer, it will light up in green, and if the player chooses an incorrect answer, it will light up in red. At the end of the quiz, the overall result will be written on the board.

The main part of the game are four (4) rooms, each of which present a different scenario to the player. Conceptually, this might resemble an escape room. By finishing the current room, they are granted access to the next one.

Each room consists of a desk, an office chair, a monitor/television, a whiteboard with magnets, a light source, a trash can, and eight papers. Most rooms also have various other elements, such as shelves, couches, pictures, etc., to make them seem more realistic. Upon the player's arrival in the room, a short video clip (up to 20 s) will be shown on the monitor/television screen. That clip refers to the title of the script written on the white board. The player then needs to find four papers with questions that can be asked in a questionnaire about subjective methods of examining the user experience related to that scenario and pin them on the board in the places marked with magnets. If one or more questions are not correct, the board will provide feedback about this, but it will not say which questions are incorrect. If all the correct questions are selected, a success message will be displayed on the board and the door to the next room will open. When the player successfully solves the tasks of all areas, the last door that will open will be the door of the classroom where he started the game.
